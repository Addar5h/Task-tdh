          The mix of <b>Tenali Double Horse Urad Gota and Idly Ravva</b> is like magic
          for making fluffy idlis. The Urad Gota, when ground carefully, gives a
          rich taste, blending perfectly with the slightly grainy feel of the
          Idly Rava. These idlis strike a great balance, being both fluffy and a
          bit grainy, making each bite super enjoyable. The combo not only makes
          them tasty but also brings together different textures in a lovely
          way. It's a special mix that turns these idlis into a delicious treat,
          showing off the goodness of using Tenali Double Horse ingredients for
          a fantastic eating experience.<br/>
